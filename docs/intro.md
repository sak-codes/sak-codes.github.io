# About Me: Sakshi Oza 


*“Science explores, data explains, and creativity connects the dots.”* 

Hi, I’m **Sakshi Oza** – a data science and open source passionate about bridging the gap between **data, technology, and innovation**. I’ve spent my last few years exploring numerous of data and turning numbers into insights and ideas into impactful solutions.  

With a strong foundation from my **M.Tech in Biological Engineering** at **IIT Gandhinagar**, I honed my skills in applying technology to solve complex challenges. Now, as a **Master of Data Science** student at **University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)**, I continue to combine analytical thinking with computational tools to advance data analysis. I believe data tells stories waiting to be heard – stories that can save lives, improve care, and transform healthcare. 


## A Glimpse of My Work 🌟  

- **Google Summer of Code (2023):**  
   Boosted graph computation efficiency by **30%** through optimized data structures and advanced algorithms, contributing to **Open Science Labs**.  
   
- **ML Projects:**  
   Achieved **97.5% AUC** in predicting cardiovascular risks using PCA, K-means clustering, and LASSO regression with datasets from **NHANES**.  

- **Research:**  
   Co-authored *“Ultrasound Biomarkers: Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound and Nakagami Imaging to Differentiate Benign and Malignant Choroidal Tumors”*, published in *Current Eye Research*.  

- **Achievements:**  
   Best Poster Finalist at **IEEE South Asian Ultrasonics Symposium** for my work on intraocular tumor differentiation using Nakagami envelope statistics.  


## Let’s Connect 🌍

I’m always excited to collaborate, share knowledge, and create impactful solutions through data. Let’s connect and build something extraordinary together!
